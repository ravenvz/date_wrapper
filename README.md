# date_wrapper
Wrapper for tiny subset of the excellent [Howard Hinnant's date lib](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date)

Howard Hinnant's library is in active development and API changes are expected, therefore this wrapper was created.

**date_wrapper** provides (arguably easy to use) DateTime and TimeInterval classes.

**date_wrapper** is intented to be used in small projects or prototypes, when you want to have date-time abstractions and
want them right now, so you can focus on your main features or try new concepts. 
It is not production-ready and never will be - dates and time are one of the most complex matters with great number of pitfalls.
