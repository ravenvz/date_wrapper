# date_wrapper
Wrapper for a subset of the excellent [Howard Hinnant's date library](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date) that provides DateTime and TimeInterval abstractions.

**date_wrapper** was created to provide bridge to Howard Hinnant's library, that was in active development and API changes were possible.

Howard Hinnant's library is now proposed to standartization; if this happens, this wrapper might be obsolete, although provided abstractions still might be useful.
